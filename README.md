- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was younger I used to think I'd be an athlete so
I went into all my shcool teams. I was a player on shot put, javelin throw and 4x100 meters relay on athletism,
also on volleyball, handball, basketball, five-a-side soccer, table tennis, chess, but not swimming. I can't swim
very well, otherwise...
We won a lot of medals in and out of the city! It was a great moment in my life!
